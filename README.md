# Gensim
Animal Generation Simulator

This program simulates an x amount of generations of an animal, according to that animal's breeding mechanics.

The number of organisms per generation is counted, producing a number pattern.

Examples of these number patterns are Fibonacci sequence for bees and powers of 2 for humans.

I got the idea for this progam, while reading "The Maths Book - Big Ideas Simply Explained".
